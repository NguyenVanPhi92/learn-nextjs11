1. Overview
   Add routings with react-router-dom in ReactJS

function App() {
// ...
return (
<Switch>
<Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />
<Route path="/login" component={LoginPage} />
<Route path="/products" component={ProductFeature} />
<Route component={NotFound} />
</Switch>
)
}

But in NextJS, we use File-system Routing, what does it means?
When a file is added to the pages directory it's automatically available as a route.
There are three kind of routes
Index routes: file named index
Nested routes: nested folder in pages
Dynamic routes: brackets in file name to match parameter dynamically

--> With pre-defined routes, one page for one URL, but what if you need to match many URLs for only one
page? Well get to the next section hehe ðŸ˜…

2. Dynamic routes
   We can use dynamic routes (bracket syntax) to support path parameters.

# Name File Path

1 Single parameter pages/posts/[postId].tsx
2 Multiple parameters pages/categories/[categoryId]/posts/[postId].tsx
3 Catch all routes pages/posts/[...slug].tsx
4 Optional catch all routes pages/posts/[[...slug]].tsx
Note: You can use names other than slug, such as: [...params]
Single parameter: pages/posts/[postId].tsx will match:

# URL router.query

1 /posts/123 { postId: '123' }
2 /posts/developer-tips { postId: 'developer-tips' }
3 /posts/developer-roadmap { postId: 'developer-roadmap' }
but it won't match /posts/developer-roadmap/something-else

Multiple parameters: pages/categories/[categoryId]/posts/[postId].tsx will match:

# URL router.query

1 /categories/123/posts/456 { categoryId: '123', postId: '456' }
2 /categories/frontend/posts/js { categoryId: 'frontend', postId: 'js' }

pages
|** categories
| |** [categoryId] (folder)
| |** posts
| |** [postId].tsx (file)

Catch all routes: pages/posts/[...slug].tsx will match:

# URL router.query

1 /posts/123 { slug: ['123'] }
2 /posts/easy-nextjs { slug: ['easy-nextjs'] }
3 /posts/easy/frontend { slug: ['easy', 'frontend'] }
4 /posts/easy/frontend/nextjs { slug: ['easy', 'frontend', 'nextjs'] }
but it won't match /posts

Optional catch all routes: pages/posts/[[...slug]].tsx will match:
Same to Catch all routes but it also match /posts 3. Route match order
Priority Name File Path Code
1 Pre-defined routes pages/posts/create.tsx A
2 Dynamic routes pages/posts/[postId].tsx B
3 Catch all routes pages/posts/[...slug].tsx C
Examples:

# if user visit it will match

1 /posts/create A
2 /posts/12345 B
3 /posts/developer-tips B
4 /posts/frontend-road-map B
5 /posts/12345/comments C
6 /posts/12345/comments/123 C
